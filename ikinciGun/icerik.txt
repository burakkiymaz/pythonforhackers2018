As used in this Agreement, “Confidential Information” means any and all information and material that:  (i) is marked “Confidential,” “Restricted,” or “Confidential Information” or other similar marking; (ii) is known by You to be confidential or proprietary; or (iii) from all the relevant circumstances, should reasonably be assumed by You to be confidential or proprietary.

Accordingly, Tenable, in addition to and not in lieu of any other rights, remedies or damages available to it at law or in equity, shall be entitled to seek appropriate injunctive relief and other measures restraining further attempted or threatened breaches of such obligations without requirement to post any bond.

14.	Exclusion of Other Damages.
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TENABLE BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON OR ENTITY FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM LOSS OF DATA, SECURITY BREACH, PROPERTY DAMAGE, LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR LOST SAVINGS), ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SOFTWARE OR TENABLE’S PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES OR OF ANY OTHER OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER OR NOT TENABLE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

(a)	Tenable shall, at its sole cost and expense, defend (or at its option, settle) and indemnify You and Your subsidiaries and affiliates, and their officers, directors, employees, representatives and agents, from and against any and all third party claims brought against You based upon a claim that use of the Software in accordance with this Agreement infringes such third party’s United States patent, copyright or trademark or misappropriates any trade secret, and shall pay all settlements entered into and damages awarded to the extent based on such claim or action, provided that You give Tenable (i) prompt notice of such action or claim; (ii) the right to control and direct the investigation, defense, and/or settlement of such action or claim; and (iii) reasonable cooperation.

(d)	This Section 16 sets forth Tenable’s sole liability and Your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any claim of intellectual property infringement.
17.	Indemnification.
(a)	Each of the parties acknowledges and agrees that by entering into and performing its obligations under this Agreement, Tenable will not assume and should not be exposed to the business and operational risks associated with Your business.

(b)	You agree that You will, at Your expense, indemnify, defend and hold Tenable harmless in all claims and actions that seek compensation of any damages that arise out of or relate to (i) Your security solutions, (ii) Your use of the Software, or (iii) a breach of Your obligations under Section 9(a) or 20.  You also agree to pay all settlements, costs, damages, legal fees and expenses finally awarded in all such claims and actions.
18.	Verification.
For the term of this Agreement and one (1) year thereafter, You agree that Tenable or its designee shall have the right, at its own expense and under reasonable conditions of time and place, to audit and copy all records of Your use of the Software.  Tenable or its designee may also require You to complete accurately a self-audit questionnaire in a form provided by Tenable.  If an audit reveals unlicensed use of the Software, a breach of this Agreement or underpayment of any Fees by You or Your employees or agents, You must, in addition to such other rights and remedies as may be available to Tenable as the result of such breach, promptly order and pay for sufficient licenses (at Tenable’s then-current price for such licenses) to permit all usage disclosed and pay the full cost of such audit and copying.  Tenable will use information obtained from such audit only to verify and enforce Your compliance with the terms of this Agreement, to comply with any governmental reporting requirements and for such other purposes as required by law.
19.	Your Payment Obligations.
You agree to pay any and all amounts due or incurred by You, including any License Fee or Support Fee or any other applicable charge, as are specified in an invoice provided by Tenable or its Vendor in consideration for Your license of the Software (the "Fees").  You further agree to pay any and all amounts due or incurred for any Professional Services as set forth in an applicable Statement of Work or detailed on a quote.  Payment for Software is due (a) within thirty (30) days of the Order Date, (b) in accordance with Your payment terms with an applicable Vendor, if any, or (c) in such other period of time as agreed to in writing by the parties. Unless otherwise agreed to in writing or as detailed in a signed Statement of Work, payment for Professional Services is due within thirty (30) days from the Order Date.   You agree to pay directly or reimburse Tenable and Vendor for any taxes (including, sales or excise taxes, value added taxes, landing fees, import duties and the like), however designated and whether foreign or domestic, arising out of this Agreement, imposed on the Software or the use thereof, or Tenable’s or Vendor’s performance under this Agreement.  You agree to pay Tenable’s and Vendor’s invoices without deducting any present or future taxes, withholdings or other charges except those deductions You are legally required to make.  If You are legally required to make any deductions, You agree to pay Tenable such amounts as are necessary to make the net amounts remaining after such deductions equal to the stated amount due under this Agreement.  The payments or reimbursements will be in such amounts as are sufficient to relieve Tenable from owing any further taxes, either directly or on the basis of the payments made under this Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Tenable will be solely responsible for its income tax obligations and all employer reporting and payment obligations with respect to its personnel.  You agree to pay any interest and penalties imposed by any taxing authorities to the extent such interest and penalties are applicable to taxes not paid at Your request or as a result of reliance by Tenable on Your representations.  If a certificate of exemption or similar document or proceeding is necessary in order to exempt any transaction from a tax, You will obtain such certificate or document.  You agree to pay for actual travel and living expenses for Professional Services where Tenable is conducting on-site work.   Payment for travel and living expenses is due thirty (30) days from the date You receive a proper invoice.  You agree to promptly pay or reimburse Tenable or its Vendor, as applicable, for all costs and expenses, including all reasonable attorneys’ fees, related to any breach of Your obligations under this Agreement.
20.	Legal Compliance; Restricted Rights.

You are solely responsible for, and agree to perform Your obligations in a manner that complies with all applicable national, federal, state and local laws, statutes, ordinances, regulations, codes and other types of government authority (including those governing export control, unfair competition, anti-discrimination, false advertising, privacy and data protection, and publicity and those identifying and requiring permits, licenses, approvals, and other consents) (“Laws”).  If a charge is made that You are not complying with any such Laws, You will promptly notify Tenable of such charges in writing.

You will, at Your sole cost and expense, obtain and maintain in effect all permits, licenses, approvals and other consents related to Your obligations under this Agreement.  You agree, at Your expense, to comply with all foreign exchange and other Laws applicable to You.  The Software (1) was developed solely at private expense, (2) contains “restricted computer software” submitted with restricted rights in accordance with FAR  52.227-19 Commercial Computer Software–Restricted Rights (June 1987) sections (a) through (d) and its successors, and (3) in all respects is proprietary data belonging to Tenable, its affiliates or their licensors or suppliers. For Department of Defense units, the Software is considered commercial computer software in accordance with DFARS section 227.7202-3 and its successors, and use, duplication or disclosure by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions set forth in this Agreement.

21.	Termination.
This Agreement and Your license to use the Software shall terminate (a) on thirty (30) days’ notice and opportunity to cure if Tenable materially breaches any of its obligations under this Agreement, or (b) automatically if You fail to comply with any term or condition of this Agreement, provided that such termination will not extinguish any future payment obligations to which You may have agreed.  Immediately after termination of this Agreement, You shall return to Tenable the Software, together with all copies, modifications and merged portions of the Software in any form, and shall certify to Tenable in writing that through Your best efforts and to the best of Your knowledge all such materials have been returned to Tenable and removed from host computers on which Software resided. The removal and deletion provisions of this Section 21 do not apply to copies of the Software that are made pursuant to Your reasonable back-up and archival policies (under which back-up tapes that will be overwritten in due course may contain copies of the Software), provided that (i) such copies are only retained by You in the course of Your back-up procedures, (ii) such copies will be deleted within a reasonable period of time in the normal course of overwriting under the back-up process, and (iii) such copies never be used to exceed the license restrictions under this Agreement.  Any Statement of Work or Professional Services obligation shall terminate (x) at either party’s convenience upon thirty (30) days’ notice to the other party, or (y) if, after thirty (30) days’ notice and opportunity to cure, a party has failed to cure a material breach of a Statement of Work or Professional Services Specifications.  Upon such termination for Tenable’s breach or by Tenable for convenience, You will only pay Tenable all fees earned up until the point of termination as well as all reimbursable expenses.
22.	Governing Law.
This Agreement shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of Maryland, USA, without regard to choice-of-law rules or principles.  No aspect or provision of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act, as implemented under Maryland law, shall apply to this Agreement. You expressly agree with Tenable that this Agreement shall not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
23.	Dispute Resolution.
You and Tenable submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Howard County, Maryland, and the United States District Court for Maryland, Baltimore Division, for any question or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement.  Due to the high costs and time involved in commercial litigation before a jury, the parties waive all right to a jury trial with respect to any and all issues in any action or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement.
24.	Notices.
Any notices or other communication required or permitted to be made or given by either party pursuant to this Agreement will be in writing, in English, and will be deemed to have been duly given when delivered if delivered personally or sent by recognized overnight express courier, to the address specified herein or such other address as a party may specify in writing.  Tenable may also provide notices to You via an email address You have provided to Tenable.  All notices to Tenable shall be sent to the attention of the Legal Department (unless otherwise specified by Tenable).
25.	Non-Solicitation.
For a period of one (1) year after completion of Professional Services, You will not, either directly or indirectly, employ or solicit for employment any person employed by Tenable or any of its affiliates then or at any time within the preceding twelve (12) months with whom You have worked in the course of Professional Services performed for You under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this restriction shall not prevent You from hiring based on a response to Your advertising in good faith to the general public a position or vacancy to which an employee or worker of Tenable responds, provided that no such advertisement shall be intended to specifically target Tenable personnel.
26.	Assignment.
You may not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement without Tenable’s prior written consent which will not be unreasonably withheld.
27.	General.
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties, and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous communications between the parties (whether written or oral) relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. No purchase order shall supersede, modify, or supplement this Agreement. Any amendment to the terms of this Agreement must be in writing and signed by the parties. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed severable, and the unenforceability of any one or more provisions will not affect the enforceability of any other provisions.  Section headings are for convenience only and shall not be considered in the interpretation of this Agreement. In addition, if any provision of this Agreement, for any reason, is declared to be unenforceable, the parties will substitute an enforceable provision that, to the maximum extent possible under applicable law, preserves the original intentions and economic positions of the parties.  Unless Tenable agrees otherwise, You agree that Tenable may use Your name and/or logo in a customer list.  Neither party shall be liable for any loss or delay (including failure to meet the service level commitment) resulting from any force majeure event, including, but not limited to, acts of God, fire, natural disaster, terrorism, labor stoppage, Internet service provider failures or delays, civil unrest, war or military hostilities, criminal acts of third parties, and any payment date or delivery date shall be extended to the extent of any delay resulting from any force majeure event.  The parties are independent contractors and this Agreement will not establish any relationship of partnership, joint venture, employment, franchise or agency between the parties.  No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right, power or remedy will operate as a waiver of that right, power or remedy, and no waiver will be effective unless it is in writing and signed by the waiving party.  If a party waives any right, power or remedy, the waiver will not waive any successive or other right, power or remedy the party may have under this Agreement.  Any provision of this Agreement that imposes or contemplates continuing obligations on a party will survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement, including Sections 3 through 4 and 11 through 23 and Section 25.  “Including” and its derivatives (such as “include” and “includes”) mean including without limitation; this term is as defined, whether or not capitalized in this Agreement.
28.	Language.
The language of this Agreement is English and all notices given under this Agreement must be in English to be effective.  No translation, if any, of this Agreement or any notice will be of any effect in the interpretation of this Agreement or in determining the intent of the parties.  The parties have expressly agreed that all invoices and related documents be drafted in English.
29.	Third Parties.
This Agreement is not intended nor will it be interpreted to confer any benefit, right or privilege in any person or entity not a party to this Agreement.  Any party who is not a party to this Agreement has no right under any Law to enforce any term of this Agreement.
30.	Government Entities.
(a)	If You are prohibited by law, regulation, or relevant attorney general opinion from (collectively, “Restrictions”), the following sections shall be modified to the extent necessary to allow You to comply with such Restrictions:
(b)	Section 10 (Confidentiality) may be amended to comply with any public records statute with which You are bound to comply.
(c)	Section 17 (Indemnification), subpart (b) may be deleted in its entirety.

15.	Additional Provisions Regarding Liability.
The limitations of liability set forth in Sections 13 and 14 will survive and apply notwithstanding the failure of any limited or exclusive remedy for breach of warranty set forth in this Agreement.  The parties agree that the foregoing limitations will not be read so as to limit any liability to an extent that would not be permitted under applicable law and specifically will not limit any liability for (i) death or personal injury caused by Tenable’s negligence or (ii) fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation.
16.	Intellectual Property Infringement Indemnification.
(a)	Subject to Section 14, Tenable will defend and/or settle all third party claims, actions and lawsuits asserting that Your operation of the Software infringes an intellectual property right in Ireland and/or the United States, provided that: (i) You shall provide Tenable with prompt written notice of any claim or lawsuit; (ii) Tenable shall have sole control of the defense and all negotiations for settlement or compromise thereof; (iii) You shall reasonably cooperate in the defense of such claim or lawsuit (at Tenable’s cost); and (iv) Tenable shall only pay infringement claim defense costs, Tenable-negotiated settlement amounts, and/or damages finally awarded against You by a court of competent jurisdiction.
(b)	If Your use of the Software is, or in Tenable’s opinion is likely to be, the subject of an infringement claim, or if required by settlement, Tenable may, in its sole discretion and expense, (i) substitute for the Software substantially functionally similar non-infringing software; (ii) procure for You the right to continue using the Software; or (iii) terminate this Agreement, accept return of the Software and provide a pro rata refund to You.  The pro rata refund will be calculated as follows: (1) for subscriptions, Tenable will provide a refund of any prepaid License Fees for the unused remainder of the license term; and (2) for perpetual licenses, Tenable will refund the License Fee for the Software less allowance for amortization over a thirty-six (36) month period, straight-line method as well as a pro rata refund of any prepaid Support Fee.
(c)	Tenable has no liability with respect to patent, copyright or trademark infringement or trade secret misappropriation described in Section 16(a) arising out of: (i) modifications of the Software made to Your order or specification, or not made by Tenable or any party under its control; (ii) Your use of the Software in combination with other software or equipment if such combination or other software or equipment gives rise to the infringement; (iii) Your failure to use any new or corrected versions of the Software made available by Tenable; or (iv) Your use of the Software in a manner not permitted by this Agreement.
This Section 16 sets forth Tenable’s sole liability and Your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any claim of intellectual property infringement.
22.	Governing Law.
This Agreement and any issues, disputes or claims arising out of or in connection with it (whether contractual or non-contractual in nature such as claims in tort, from breach of statute or regulation or otherwise) (“Disputes”) shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of Ireland.
You expressly agree with Tenable that this Agreement shall not be governed by the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods, the application of which is expressly excluded.
23.	Dispute Resolution.
All Disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration within the meaning of the Arbitration Act 2010 or any legislation amending or repealing that act and shall be an arbitration conducted in Dublin, Ireland in the English language and shall be governed by the Arbitration Act 2010.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement shall limit the right of either party to seek any injunctive, equitable or other interlocutory relief as it may be entitled to in the Courts of Ireland.

All provisions of the Agreement other than those explicitly changed by this Addendum shall remain in full force and effect.
